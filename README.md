## 📌 Deep Dive Analysis

**Sales Trend Analysis**

- **Quarterly average sales peaked between Q2 and Q3 in 2023, with a similar pattern in 2024 at Q3**. However, both years show a similar dip during Q4. This highlights stronger customer purchasing during Q2-Q3, likely driven by the Christmas season, followed by easing demand in Q4.

- The **significant Q4 decline** was observed primarily in **Kmart Online sales** suggests that customers continue to favor in-store shopping during the holiday period.

**Recommendations:**
- Given that average sales peak between Q2 and Q3, **leverage this period with targeted promotions, product launches, and marketing campaigns** to maximize revenue during the high-demand season.
- The sharp dip in Kmart Online sales in Q4 indicates a preference for in-store shopping during the holiday period. Consider strategies such as:
    - **Enhancing online holiday promotions and incentives** (e.g., limited-time discounts, free shipping).
    - **Implementing in-store pickup options** to bridge online and offline experiences.
    - **Improving online merchandising and holiday campaign visibility** to compete with in-store traffic.
- **Strengthen the integration between online and physical stores**, ensuring a seamless customer journey. Personalised communications and promotions based on shopping behavior (online vs. in-store) can help retain and grow sales across both channels.
- **Use historical sales trends** to optimize inventory allocation, ensuring sufficient stock in-store during Q4 while balancing online inventory **to reduce lost sales opportunities**.
- **Continuously track shifts in online vs. in-store behavior** during peak seasons. This will enable proactive adjustments in marketing, promotions, and operational planning to capture more holiday sales online.

- **Implement a stronger online holiday campaign and early Q4 promotions** to counter the pronounced decline in 2024.
- **Introduce mid-year campaigns and loyalty incentive**s to sustain throughout the year.
